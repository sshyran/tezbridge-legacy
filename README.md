## How safe is TezBridge
Now the secret key stored in localStorage is protected by `Argon2i` + `AES-PMAC-SIV`.
So even if someone gets the ciphertext, it will take a lot efforts to crack it for him.

When using TezBridge plugin, the secret key in memory is placed inside a closure of a Web Worker of the iframe.
Browsers can prevent any third party DApp from stealing it.

### For users
1. Open [https://tezbridge.github.io/](https://tezbridge.github.io/)
2. Import or create your account
3. Generate an access code
4. Open a DApp or a decentralized website
5. Paste the access code when the browser asks your for it

Tip: one access code can be used only once
